# Landscape Labor Predictor

This project predicts **labor needs for landscaping operations** based on historical work patterns and operational factors. The goal is to help landscape teams **plan staffing more accurately**, avoid under- or over-staffing, and improve daily operational efficiency.

---

## What This Project Is About

Landscaping work is highly affected by **seasonality, workload size, and job type**. Planning labor manually often leads to inefficiencies. This project uses historical data to estimate **required labor hours or crew size** for upcoming work.

---

## Why This Matters

Labor is one of the largest costs in landscaping operations. Better labor forecasting helps:

* Reduce scheduling conflicts
* Avoid overtime and idle crews
* Improve cost control and productivity
* Support better planning during peak seasons

---

## What I Analyzed

The analysis focuses on:

* Historical labor hours and job records
* Job types and workload volume
* Seasonal patterns
* Relationships between workload and labor demand

---

## How the Prediction Works

* Cleaned and prepared historical landscaping data
* Identified key factors that influence labor demand
* Built a predictive model to estimate labor requirements
* Evaluated results to ensure realistic and usable outputs

---

## Key Outputs

* Estimated labor hours or crew size per job
* Insights into factors driving labor demand
* A simple framework that can support workforce planning

---

## Tools Used

* Data analysis and modeling tools
* Python / analytics libraries
* Structured modeling workflow

---

## Outcome

The project provides a practical way to **forecast labor demand in landscaping operations**, supporting better workforce planning and more efficient use of resources.
